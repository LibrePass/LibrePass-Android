# LibrePass Android

LibrePass represents an innovative cloud-based password manager known for its user-friendly 
simplicity and performance.
It functions not only as a tool for generating secure passwords 
but also facilitates their synchronization across various devices.

All passwords stored in LibrePass are securely placed in an encrypted vault.
This ensures that users can have full confidence
that their passwords will remain private and inaccessible to unauthorized individuals.
